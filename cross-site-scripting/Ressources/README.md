Looking around the website, we discovered a feedback form at http://localhost:8080/index.php?page=feedback that appeared vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).

Upon testing, we found that submitting just the JavaScript keyword `alert` in the form was successful in triggering code execution when the feedback was later rendered on the page. This indicates that user input is being stored in the database and then directly inserted into the page's JavaScript context without proper sanitization or encoding - a classic stored XSS vulnerability. This successful exploitation revealed a flag.

To remediate this vulnerability, the application should:
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization before storing user data
- Apply context-appropriate output encoding when rendering stored data (variables should not be interpreted as code instead of text)
- Consider implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict execution of inline scripts
